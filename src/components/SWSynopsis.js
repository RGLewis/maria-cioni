        <p>From the start, the reader is asked to: <span className="italic">Imagine that Italian food did not exist — that spaghetti, ravioli and chicken cacciatore could not be found on any menu.</span> What did it take to open Calgary’s first Italian restaurant in 1949? It took an Italian immigrant — Genesio (Gene) Cioni — his family, his partner-wife, a love of cooking memory-infused Italian food, his training and an entrepreneurial vision to know that his Italian restaurants could be part of the change in Calgary during the fabulous fifties.</p>

        <p>Gene was just sixteen when he arrived from Antrodoco, in the Abruzzi region of Italy, to find one vibrant, close-knit Italian community in the burgeoning city of Calgary, Alberta in the 1920s. It is in this unlikely frontier city that Gene risked leaving his barber profession to follow a passion for food and cooking, as he worked his way through the CPR companies from hotel busboy to cook on work trains in Western Canada, to eventually become one of the first "celebrity chefs" in the region.</p>

        <p>The author recreates a Saturday night at Gene’s LaVilla in lively detail, reminiscent of the celebration in the film <span className="bold">Big Night</span>, (directed by Campbell Scott and Stanley Tucci) the food, the ambience, the music, the clothes, and the conversation. With Martha, his wife managing the front of house, Gene's was a meeting place for Sugarfoot Anderson, Stu Hart, Duke Ellington, Primo Carnera and city society, including business leaders, sports heroes, and politicians, but Gene always had room in his restaurant and his heart for Italian immigrants who needed advice and a helping hand.</p>

        <p>Maria's recollections of growing up in a restaurant family are authentic, detailed, and perceptive, bringing alive the food and treasured traditions that enriched her family's life. Included in the book are a handful of favourite recipes — the secret spaghetti sauce for one hundred people, meatballs, polenta, lasagne, gnocchi — foods that Maria describes in sensual detail and we witness Gene’s original style of cooking Calgary’s T-bone steaks, his famous anchovy salad and how he introduced the first Pizza pie.</p>

        <p><span className="bold">Spaghetti Western</span> reveals the toils and triumphs of the immigration experience, particularly that of Gene's mother, Flavia, whose remarkable story of sacrifice and determination changed the course of her son’s life. Italian immigrants frequently faced discrimination and suspicion, especially during the Second World War when they were classified as enemy aliens. For Gene and his German-American wife, Martha, it was doubly difficult; in response, they worked even harder leading Gene to determine there would be no bias of any kind in his restaurants.</p>

        <p>Drawing from interviews with family, members of the Italian community and former La Villa patrons, as well as archival sources, Maria has created a period in Calgary’s history through a fascinating portrait of Gene Cioni, his restaurants, and his family and community. <span className="bold">Spaghetti Western</span> is a love story to a father who "sped through his days like a Ferrari race car", leaving a legacy of good food, good memories and a city in love with Italy.</p>
